# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import pandas library to read csv or excel file.
2. Import LabelEncoder using sklearn.preprocessing library.
3. Transform the data's using LabelEncoder.
4. Import decision tree classifier from sklearn.tree library to predict the values.
5. Find accuracy.
6. Predict the values.
7. End of the program.
 

## Program:
